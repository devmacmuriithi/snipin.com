Great — let’s walk through the **workflow of a “thought post”** in this resonance-driven network. Imagine you, as a human, post a snip (a raw thought). What happens next:

---

## 🌀 Workflow of a Thought Post (Snip)

### 1. **Creation**

* User (or neural interface in future) creates a snip:

  ```plaintext
  "What if cities could breathe like forests?"
  ```
* This snip gets a **unique ID** and metadata (user, timestamp, context).

---

### 2. **Embedding & Enrichment**

* AI converts the snip into a **vector embedding** (semantic fingerprint).
* Additional enrichment:

  * **Contextualization**: AI expands the meaning (“urban sustainability, biomimicry, adaptive architecture”).
  * **Tags / Categories** auto-generated.
  * **Emotional tone** detected (curiosity, hope).

---

### 3. **Resonance Detection**

* The snip embedding is compared against all existing snips.
* System finds **nearest neighbors** (other thoughts semantically aligned).
* A **Resonance Score** is computed for each connection (cosine similarity, threshold filtering).
* Example:

  * Resonates 0.88 with: *“Buildings that act like living organisms”*
  * Resonates 0.74 with: *“Smart cities learning from ecosystems”*

---

### 4. **Resonances Table Update**

* Each resonance creates an entry:

  ```plaintext
  snip_id: 123
  resonating_snip_id: 456
  score: 0.88
  thinking: "Both explore architecture as biology-inspired"
  explanation: "High similarity in themes of biomimicry + sustainability"
  ```
* Stored in the **resonances table**, forming a *thought web*.

---

### 5. **Resonance Metrics & Feedback**

* The snip’s **Resonance Score (global)** = aggregate measure of how many strong connections it has + their intensities.
* Shown to the user like:

  * “🌌 Your thought resonated with 37 other thoughts.”
  * “🔥 Strong resonance with biomimicry thinkers.”

---

### 6. **Discovery & Surfacing**

* Other users with resonating snips are notified:

  * *“Your thought about living buildings resonated with Martin’s new snip.”*
* The snip becomes part of **snip nets** (clusters).
* Users can explore **resonance pathways**: follow how one thought leads to others.

---

### 7. **Evolution of the Snip**

* Snips can evolve:

  * AI can **generate derivative snips** (expansions, counterpoints, creative riffs).
  * Human can **merge resonances** into larger thought threads.
  * Collective resonance may cause **new nodes (subnets)** to emerge.

---

### 🚀 Example in Motion:

1. You post: *“What if cities could breathe like forests?”*
2. AI embeds → finds resonance with biomimicry snips.
3. Resonances table logs those links.
4. You see: *“Resonated with 37 thoughts, strongest on biomimicry & smart cities.”*
5. Others with related thoughts get pinged.
6. A **biomimicry subnet** grows stronger, with you at its frontier.

This is **like posting on Twitter**, except instead of counting likes, you’re **growing resonance waves** across thought space.

👉 Do you want me to design a **visual diagram workflow (nodes, embeddings, resonance scoring)** so you can literally *see* how a thought ripples into a snip net?
