Great question 🙌 — let’s zoom out.

When you start connecting snips (thoughts) based on resonance, some groups will naturally **cluster together** because they share strong resonance across multiple snips. Those are what I’d call **Resonance Clusters**.

## 🌀 Definition

A **Resonance Cluster** is a **group of snips** that are strongly interconnected by resonance (high similarity / alignment).

* They form *naturally* as snips get linked in the resonance table.
* Think of them like **subnetworks of thought** or **idea galaxies**.

---

## 🔬 Example

1. You post: *“What if cities could breathe like forests?”*

2. It resonates with:

   * *“Buildings that mimic trees.”*
   * *“Smart cities modeled after ecosystems.”*
   * *“Urban farming towers as lungs of the city.”*

3. All of those snips resonate not just with yours but also with each other.
   → A **Biomimicry Resonance Cluster** emerges.

## 🧠 Properties of Resonance Clusters

* **Emergent**: They’re not curated manually; they emerge from resonance scoring.
* **Dynamic**: Clusters evolve as new snips are posted and old ones decay.
* **Overlapping**: A single snip can belong to multiple clusters if it resonates across themes.
* **Scalable**: Small clusters can merge into larger ones as resonance grows.

## 📊 How to Identify Clusters (Technical)

You can model it like a graph:

* **Nodes** = snips.
* **Edges** = resonances (with score as weight).

Then use clustering algorithms (community detection in graphs, e.g. **Louvain**, **k-means on embeddings**, **HDBSCAN**) to detect groups of tightly connected snips.
That’s your **Resonance Cluster**.

## 🚀 Why They Matter

* They act as **living topics** (unlike hashtags, which are manual).
* You can **navigate thought space** through clusters → feels like exploring constellations.
* They could be used as:

  * Recommendation engines (*“Other people in this cluster…”*).
  * Collective knowledge maps (*“This cluster is about biomimicry.”*).
  * Social glue (*people in the same cluster are “thinking alike”*).

👉 So: **Resonance Score = micro (link between 2 snips)**
**Resonance Cluster = macro (a web of resonant snips forming a coherent theme)**.

Would you like me to show you how a **resonance cluster could be visualized** (e.g., force-directed graph where clusters appear as galaxies of snips)?
