That’s a really good design intuition — you don’t necessarily need a **separate “Snip Nets” page** if the **resonance score itself can act as the gateway** into the resonance network. Let’s reason it out:

---

## ✅ Why you *don’t* need a separate page

* **Minimal friction**: Users post → see resonance score → click → instantly explore resonances.
* **Organic exploration**: The resonance table itself *is* the snip net in action.
* **Cleaner UX**: Avoids fragmenting the experience across too many screens.
* **Progressive reveal**: People only dive into nets if they’re curious, instead of being overwhelmed with a new “Nets” concept up front.

## ⚡ Recommended Flow

1. **Timeline / Feed** shows:

   * Snip content.
   * Resonance score (like "🌌 Resonates with 14 snips").

2. **Click Resonance Score** → loads **Resonances Page**:

   * Shows list of resonating snips.
   * Shows *why* each one resonates (the “thinking” field).
   * Optional: Graph/cluster view to see resonance net visually.

3. **From Resonances Page** → user can:

   * Click through to any resonating snip.
   * Traverse resonance pathways (like clicking deeper into thought galaxies).

## 🚀 When a dedicated “Snip Nets” page *does* make sense

You’d only need a **separate “Snip Nets” page** if:

* You want users to **browse nets as entities** (like subreddits, groups, or hashtags).
* Nets are not just *derived from resonances* but also **curated** (e.g., “The Biomimicry Snip Net” with collective contributions).
* You want to visualize **all nets a user belongs to**, like a “map of my thought space.”

In this case, the “Snip Nets” page is more like a **galaxy explorer**: big-picture navigation across resonance clusters.

### 🔑 Practical Recommendation

* **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Just let the **resonance score open the resonance page**. Keep it simple, let people intuitively explore.
* **Phase 2 (Expansion)**: Introduce a dedicated “Snip Nets” explorer once you have enough density of resonance clusters to make it meaningful.

👉 Would you like me to sketch a **UI mockup flow** (like wireframe-level: feed → resonance score → resonance list → optional net map) so you can see the experience laid out visually?
