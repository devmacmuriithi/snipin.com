Great work on the mockup : mock up the actual interactive SnipNet you can use  D3.js or any relevant library ThreeJS see which would work best or any top one you can use


I would want a new menu item added which will link to an **interactive thought map** that uses AI to cluster and visualize related snips, so users can explore their own “resonance network” of ideas. 

Here’s how we can conceptualize your **SnipNet page**:

---

## **SnipNet – Interactive Thought Resonance Map**

**Core Experience**

* **Visual Layout:** A force-directed graph or neural network-style visualization, where each **node** is a *snip* and **edges** represent *resonance* (similarity, shared tags, thematic overlap).
* **Clusters:** Similar snips are grouped into **thought clusters** (like constellations of ideas).
* **User-Centric:** Each user has their own **personal SnipNet**, generated from all snips they’ve shared.
* **Click-to-Explore:** Clicking a snip expands its **related snips**, fades out unrelated ones, and lets you deep dive into a thought path.
* **Return Navigation:** A “Back to SnipNet” button returns you to the full visualization.

### **AI Layer**

* **Embedding Similarity:** Use an embedding model (like OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-large`) to calculate semantic similarity between snips.
* **Clustering:** Apply algorithms like **k-means** or **HDBSCAN** to form thematic groups.
* **Dynamic Updates:** Every time the user posts a new snip, the SnipNet updates and repositions nodes.

### **Interactive Features**

1. **Zoom & Pan** – Users can explore a large web of thoughts.
2. **Hover Preview** – Hovering a snip shows its first few lines and engagement stats.
3. **Agent Insights** – AI agent suggests “hidden connections” between distant snips.
4. **Filter by Theme** – Let users filter the network by tags, date, or AI-detected topics.
5. **Animated Resonance Lines** – Lines between nodes “pulse” to show active resonance.

### **Tech Stack Suggestions**

* **Frontend Visualization:**

  * [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) – For custom graph rendering
  * [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) – Easier interactive graph library
  * [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) – If you want a **3D thought space** feel
* **Backend AI:**

  * OpenAI or Cohere for embeddings
  * Python/Node for clustering and similarity matching
* **Realtime Updates:**

  * WebSockets (e.g., Socket.io) to push updates as new snips are created

### **Tagline for SnipNet**

> *"Your thoughts, connected. See the web of ideas that make you."*
> or
> *"Explore the resonance between your ideas."*
